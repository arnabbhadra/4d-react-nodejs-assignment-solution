# 4D Technical Assessment - React/Node.js

## Introduction

Welcome to the technical assessment for the 4D Engineering team. This assessment simulates a real-world project scenario where you'll work on Admin Insurance, our document management system designed for large organizations.

## Project Overview

Admin Insurance helps organizations manage employee documentation processes across multiple countries. The system handles form submissions, document processing, and maintains data security and accessibility standards.

## Current System Components

1. Landing Page: Basic introduction and navigation
2. Form Page: Form submission 
3. Results Page: Data search

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v21.1.0 or higher)
- npm (v10.2.0 or higher)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd 4d-react-node-assignment-solution
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend servers
npm run dev:full

# Or start them separately:
npm run dev        # Frontend only
npm run server     # Backend only
```

4. Access the application:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:3000

## Project Structure

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/             # Page components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ services/          # API services
â”œâ”€â”€ server/                # Backend server code
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                 # Test files

â””â”€â”€ tickets/              # Implementation tickets
```

## Testing

The project includes both WebDriverIO and Playwright for testing. Here's an example test:

```typescript
// tests/e2e/playwright/form.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('form submission workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to form page
  await page.goto('/form');
  
  // Fill required fields
  await page.fill('input[name="firstName"]', 'John');
  await page.fill('input[name="lastName"]', 'Doe');
  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'john.doe@example.com');
  
  // Submit form
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  
  // Verify submission
  await expect(page.locator('text=Form submitted successfully')).toBeVisible();
});
```

Run tests using:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:wdio
npm run test:playwright
```

## Implementation Tickets

Detailed specifications for each implementation task can be found in the `tickets/` directory. Please select the tickets assigned to you and implement them according to the specifications.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:
- Code architecture and design patterns
- Component structure and reusability
- Testing implementation
- Documentation quality
- Performance optimization techniques

## Note About AI Tools

While you may use AI tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot for assistance, ensure that you fully understand and can explain all code implementations. The core solution should reflect your technical thinking and problem-solving approach.

## Documentation  
  In the submission we have solved **JIRA-301** and **JIRA-302**. Both are backend issues where we have created a new **end point** to upload file (csv and txt only) and parse the data and store it (JIRA-301). Also we have implement **advance search** of the submission by modifying an existing api (JIRA-302). Before going deep into the solution, we have restructured the `/server/` folder.  
  use `main` brach of this repo.
  ### Backend server structure
 ``` 
4d-react-node-assignment-solution/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                   # Frontend source code
â”œâ”€â”€ server/                # Backend server code
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ controllers      # controllers
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ middleware       # Middlewares
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ routers          # all routes comes here
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ services         # service codes
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ utils            # utility functions 
â”‚     â””â”€â”€ index.js         # main application server
â”‚ 
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                 # Test files
â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/               # Stroing uploaded files
â””â”€â”€ tickets/               # Implementation tickets
```

### JIRA-301
  A new API end point is created which takes a file CSV or TXT file as input and process, validate and parse and finally store the information.
  ```
  POST /api/upload
  ```

  A NPM package multer is used for file upload.
  A middleware `fileMiddleware` is created for handling file upload and after that `upLoadFileAndParse` is used to parse the file, validate and insert of new record by using `convertFromTxt`, `convertFromCSV` and `insertSubmissionsInBulk` utils and services.
  Form the file extension, the file type is identified.
  We have also validate the Header and mapped the header with the stored key by `headerToFieldMapper` utility function.
  `handleFileUploadError` middleware is used to handle the error during file upload

### JIRA-302
  To solve this issue, ```/api/submission``` api is modiled with a query param `search_text`
  Example.
  ```
  GET /api/submissions?search_text=startDate:2020-01-01..2020-01-01

  GET /api/submissions?search_text=John

  GET /api/submissions
  ``` 
  If you look into the `searchSubmissions` controller, you can find that if `search_text` query parameter is not provided then filter is disabled and all submissions is returned.
  To validate user input (date) and date range, `checkDateFormat`, `isDateInDateRange` functions are used heavily. 
  Note: The search is **Case Sensitive**.
  ### More Information
  It is necessary to mention that `router` are used for code maintainability is used in application. Ex.
  ```
  app.use('/api', router);
  ```
  A middleware is used to application level variable make available in request object to make it available in controller with out passing it separately as a separate function parameter.

  ``` bash
  # middleware
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
    req.submissions = submissions;
    next();
  });
  ```
### Documentation Folder
In `4d-react-node-assignment-solution/documentation` folder sample csv and text file is shared as well as postman collection is provided in the same folder for reference.
